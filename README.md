# udacity_data_wrangling

Udacity Data Wrangling Project of WeRateDogs Tweets. The objective is to go through the process of Data Wrangling (gathering data from different sources and formats, assessing and cleaning the data) extensively for Data Analysis and Visualization. The data sources consisted of an tweet archive with various information on a single tweet, a predicition file for predicting the dog's breed and a tweets list with additional information that was gathered via the Twitter API. After the wrangling the data was cleaned and stored in a single file so analysis could be handled.

For more details on the steps taken, check the wrangle_report. Findings about the data can be found on the act_report.
